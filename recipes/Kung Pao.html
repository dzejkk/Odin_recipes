    <p>Kung Pao Chicken is a dish featuring small pieces of diced chicken, peanuts, and dried red chili peppers.While the dish originated in Sichuan province, its fame brought it to other provinces as well, each with their own regional variation and flavor.</p>
    <p>The dish has also made its way out of China, and remains a common sight on Chinese takeout menus in countries around the world.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Boneless skinless chicken breast.</li>
        <li>Soy sauce (or tamari)</li>
        <li>Vinegar (rice vinegar or sherry vinegar)</li>
        <li>Cornstarch.</li>
        <li>Granulated sugar.</li>
        <li>Red & green bell peppers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the Kung Pao sauce: mix the soy sauce, vinegar and sugar in a bowl. (yeah, itâ€™s that simple.) </li>
        <li>Prep the chicken! Cut the boneless, skinless chicken breast into uniform strips. This is a little easier to do if your chicken is slightly frozen. Then, toss it in a little soy sauce and cornstarch to coat. </li>
        <li>Cook the chicken until crispy! Working in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan, stir-fry the chicken pieces in sesame oil until they're cooked through and gorgeously crispy. </li>
        <li>Stir-fry! Stir-fry the bell peppers until they're a little soft. Then add the scallions, cashews, ginger, garlic, and dried chili peppers. Stir fry all of that for a minute or two, and then stir in the Kung Pao sauce and cooked chicken. </li>
        <li>Simmer. Let all of the flavors meld over the heat for a few more minutes. The Kung Pao sauce will thicken slightly and really coat the veggies and chicken, which is what you want.</li>
        <li>Serve! We love to serve this over steaming bowls of white or brown rice. </li>
    </ol>
