    <figcaption>The eponymous breaded and fried veal escalope wasn't actually invented in Vienna - but it surely is where they make it best.</figcaption>
    <p>The Wiener Schnitzel is Vienna's most famous dish and well known around the world.</p>
    <p>The true origin of the Wiener Schnitzel has become a matter of vigorous debate between culinary historians. One thing, however, is absolutely certain: the Wiener Schnitzel is truly cosmopolitan.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 veal cutlets, 150 – 180 g / 5 - 6 oz each (alternatively, use pork or turkey) </li>
        <li>2 eggs </li>
        <li>Approx. 100 g / 3/4 cup coarse-ground flour </li>
        <li>Approx. 100 g / 3/4 cup breadcrumbs </li>
        <li>Salt, pepper </li>
        <li>Clarified butter and/or plant oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay out the cutlets, remove any skin and pound until thin. Season on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour and breadcrumbs into separate flat plates, beat the eggs together on a further plate using a fork.
            Coat each schnitzel on both sides in flour, then draw through the beaten eggs, ensuring that no part of the schnitzel remains dry. Lastly, coat in the breadcrumbs and carefully press down the crumbs using the reverse side of the fork (this causes the crumb coating to “fluff up” better during cooking).</li>
        <li>
            In a large pan (or 2 medium-sized pans), melt sufficient clarified butter for the schnitzel to be able to swim freely in the oil (or heat up the plant oil with 1 – 2 tbsp of clarified butter or butter).
            Only place the schnitzel in the pan when the fat is so hot that it hisses and bubbles up if some breadcrumbs or a small piece of butter is added to it.
            Depending on the thickness and the type of meat, fry for 2 to 4 minutes until golden brown. Turn using a spatula (do not pierce the coating!) and fry on the other side until it is of similar colour.</li>
        <li>
            Remove the crispy schnitzel and place on kitchen paper to dry off. Dab carefully. Arrange the schnitzel on the plate and garnish with slices of lemon before serving.
            Serve with parsley potatoes, rice, potato salad or mixed salad.</li>
    </ol>
